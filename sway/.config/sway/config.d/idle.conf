### Idle configuration
#
# Example configuration:
# #
# lock screen
exec swayidle -w -C ~/.config/swayidle/lock-config
#
# screen power
# exec swayidle -w \
#          timeout 10 'swaymsg "output * power off"' \
#          resume 'swaymsg "output * power on"'

# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.
